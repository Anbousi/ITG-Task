<h1>How To Use</h1>
<h3><a href="/">Back</a></h3>
<pre>This web program was built using Java programming language with Spring boot 4.
The main purpose of this program is to calculate the Path between two node “Start and Goal nodes” using three different graph searching algorithms.
1-	Uniform Cost Search Algorithm.
2-	Greedy Best Search Algorithm.
3-	A* Search Algorithm.
The program will receive the data through uploading a “.CSV file”. This file will contain a 2D Array, which define the Nodes and the connections between these Nodes. These nodes will be transformed to a weighted and directed Graph data structure at first, then the program will be allowed to start the search depending on the selected search algorithm.
The result will be shown in a table with fields of (Algorithm, # of Evaluated Nodes, Evaluated Nodes, Path and Distance).
